## Summer Project 
**Zion Taber**

The purpose of this project is to create a web program that increases the mental toughness of its members. 
It will do this through  providing users with randomized workouts based on maximum and minimum lengths of the workout.
The exercises will be varied from cardiovascular exercises to strength based ones. Membership will require minimal equipment.

By providing users with randomized workouts, an element of uncertainty will be added. 
By adding uncertainty to workouts, users will train their brains as well as their bodies.
